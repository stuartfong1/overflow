Welcome to Group 10's major project for CISC 204!

This is a solver for a game called Overflow, a mini-game inside of the popular massively multiplayer online game Animal Jam. The goal is to create a continuous path from the ocean at the top down to the moat of a sandcastle. This is accomplished by rotating square tiles containing either a straight path, curved path, or a bridge. Given the layout of a level, the solver finds a solution if one exists. In addition, it finds the longest possible path in order to maximize the number of points gained.


## üê≥ Setting up Docker image

### Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t cisc204 .
```

### Run Docker image

```bash
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/PROJECT cisc204
```


## üåä Using the solver

### Run the program
```bash
python3 overflow.py
```

### Arguments
`--no-logic`: Use the Python implementation of calculating the path length.

`--verbose`: Print detailed processing information onto the screen.


## üè∞ Structure

### General or provided

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.

### Custom code

* `overflow.py`: Contains the code to build and run the model.
* `viz.py`: Used to visualize solutions.
